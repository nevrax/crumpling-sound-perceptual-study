# Web-based Sound Perceptual Study

![example screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

This perceptual study is used in our SIGGRAPH Asia paper [Crumpling Sound Synthesis](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/crumpling/) [Cirio et al. 2016]. The codebase is forked from [Alec Jacobson's github codebase](https://github.com/alecjacobson/perceptual-study). We made a few changes so that it better supports the audio file play and stop features. 

For a live demo, try [this](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/crumpling/perceptual-study/).
To complete the whole study, one might take upto 30 minutes.

The following is from the orignal description.

> Then you can suck out the individual data entries in batch using your favorite
